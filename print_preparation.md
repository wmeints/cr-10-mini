# Print preparation guide
We follow a specific process for setting up our printer for printing. 
We've found that it helps to follow specific steps in order to get the 
best print quality possible.

## Step 1: Clean the printerbed with isopropyl alcohol
To make sure that the print sticks to the printerbed, clean it with a bit 
of isopropyl acohol. This removes fatty fingerprints and dust from the printerbed.

## Step 2: Check the filament
When you haven't replaced the filament, you can skip this step. But when you
do use a different filament, check the spool to see if it runs freely and make
sure there are no tangles in the filament.

## Step 2: Check the printer head
Sometimes the printerhead gets a little dirty, because plastic is oozing out. 
Make sure that it is clean and ready to use.

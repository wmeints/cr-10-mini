# CR-10 mini guides
This is a collection of knowledge about the CR-10 mini 3D printer that my wife 
and I got for our birthdays in 2018. 

In this repository we collect all sorts of guides about our 3D printer. 
Some guides will contain information on how to upgrade various parts of the 
printer. Other guides will help you troubleshoot things with the printer.

## The guides
 - [Leveling your printer](leveling_guide.md)
 - [General tips and tricks](tips_and_tricks.md)
